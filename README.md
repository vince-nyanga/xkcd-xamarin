# xkcd-xamarin

A simple Xamarin Forms app that I built to test my Xamarin skills. The architecture I used was inspired by the eBook [Enterprise Application Patterns Using Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/enterprise-application-patterns/).

## Disclaimer

This is by no means clean and neither is it production ready. The goal here was to see if I can apply what I have learned and build something that works (kind of :wink:). When I gain more Xamarin.Forms skills I might look at this with disdain and hopefully refactor it to something I can be proud of.
